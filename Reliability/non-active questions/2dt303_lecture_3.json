    "Question": "Explain the difference of Fail, Fault and Failures",
    "Answer": "*Fault : A fault is the cause of an error. It can be a design fault, a cosmic ray or whatever. If, as you point out, the fault is not activated, no error is produced.\n*Error : An error is the part of the system state that may lead to a failure to difference between Actual Output and Expected output\n*Failure : A failure occurs whenever the actual service delivered by a system deviates from its expected service."

  {
    "Question": "Explain how fault, threat and failure of a component affects the system it is used in ",
    "Answer": "The fault within the component will lead to an error in that component. wich wil lead to a failure since teh component is no longer provide the service it is designed for.\n The system using that component will have a fault(the component) wich will lead to an erronious state wich will result in a failure of the system"

    "Question": "Explain hazards and accidents",
    "Answer": "A hazard is the potential risk of catastrophe\nAn accident is a realized hazzard that has caused an accident"

  {
    "Question": "Explain some fault characteristics",
    "Answer": "*Active faults: pressent and causes an error\n*Dormant pressent but does not cause an error\n*Permanent: always active and remains\n*Intermitent: Rarley occurs(disturbance or hardware selection)\n*Trancient: fault that occurs temporarily(enviromental conditions, high/low temperature)"
  },
  {
    "Question": "Explain the Classes of Fault",
    "Answer": "*Degredation faults: aging components caused by long-time use beyond the systems life-time\n*Design fault: originates from faulty design\n*Byzantine faults: one fault for one user might not be observed for another"

    "Question": "Explain the bathtub curve",
    "Answer": "In a systems life-tiem a faulty components will be discovered rellativly early, making allot of faulty units to be discovered in teh near future off teh release of the sytem. later on rellativly few sytems will end up as deffective. But when nearing the end-pf-life of the sytem an increasing number of units will start to age due to degradation faults"
